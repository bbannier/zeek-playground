This repository contains a sample environment for developing Zeek scripts in a [VSCode Dev Container](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/create-dev-container). With the [Remote Containers extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers) installed, opening this folder in VSCode should pop up an option to open this project in a remote container which comes preconfigured with Zeek-related development tooling installed. Alternatively click [here](https://vscode.dev/redirect?url=vscode://ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers/cloneInVolume?url=https://github.com/bbannier/zeek-playground) for an automated setup.
